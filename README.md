# sql-warden

A governed SQL gateway that lets an AI agent query a real database safely. The rules are
enforced by the server, not trusted to the prompt.

Every query runs through a series of checks before it touches the database:

1. **Shape**: it must be a single read-only `SELECT` within the approved structural rules.
2. **Access**: it may touch only approved tables and columns.
3. **Cost**: the database's own planner estimates the cost, and anything too expensive is
   refused before it runs.
4. **Budget**: each session has a query budget.
5. **Masking**: sensitive columns come back masked.

Any check can refuse a query with a specific code and reason. Every request is recorded in
a separate audit database.

Agents connect over MCP. Humans can use the `sql-warden` CLI.

> **Status:** under construction (Phase 0: scaffolding).

## Development

Requires [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/) and Docker.

```bash
uv sync                                   # create .venv with Python 3.12 + dev tools
uv run ruff check . && uv run ruff format --check .
uv run mypy                               # strict
uv run pytest                             # unit + integration tests
uv run pytest -m "not integration"        # skip tests that need Docker
```
